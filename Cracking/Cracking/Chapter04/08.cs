/*
 * You have two very large binary trees: T1, with millions of nodes, and T2, with
 * hundreds of nodes. Create an algorithm to decide if T2 is a subtree of T1.
 * 
 * A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node n in T1 such that the subtree of
 * n is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would
 * be identical.
